##Gathering the IWC components to Host
All parts of the IWC bus can be gathered via bower by running `bower install ozoneplatform/ozp-iwc` or adding the following to your bower.json dependencies
```
 "ozp-iwc": "ozoneplatform/ozp-iwc"
```
The required components will be in `bower_components/ozp-iwc/dist`

If gathering the IWC via bower is not possible, The [dist](https://github.com/ozoneplatform/ozp-iwc/tree/master/dist) directory from the master branch of this repository is what you will need to copy over to your hosting instance.
