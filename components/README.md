##Components
These components are included in the distribution of the IWC. They are not core features of the library, rather
modules/tools/programs that can be included in a build to complement the IWC. Reference the README of a component for how to
build the IWC to include it. The following components are included in the github tagged releases.

####Debugger

The debugger is a angular based web app that utilizes a `Debugger` client of the IWC. This application inspects the
local connection to hosted IWC and can report metric data, view current values of api resources, as well as monitor
packet level transmission of IWC messages.

**This component is included with github IWC tagged releases. It is reached at (IWC URL)/debugger.html.**

The latest hosted IWC version's debugger can be found
